# PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains analysis of the PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data. PJM Interconnection LLC is a key regional transmission organization in the United States, operating in numerous states and the District of Columbia. The data represents hourly power consumption across various regions in megawatts (MW). It provides an insightful view into the energy consumption patterns and can be crucial for predictive modeling and trend analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the PJM's official website. It includes hourly power consumption data in MW, covering an extensive regional area. Notably, the regions covered by PJM have evolved over time, resulting in varying data availability for specific dates and regions.

## Repository Contents
- **Data Files:** The raw data files obtained from PJM.
- **Analysis Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the data analysis process.
- **Models:** Predictive models for energy consumption.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and plots illustrating energy consumption trends and patterns.

## Possible Analysis
This dataset opens up numerous possibilities for in-depth analysis and modeling, such as:
1. **Predictive Modeling:** Splitting the last year of data to create a test set, and developing models to forecast energy consumption.
2. **Trend Analysis:** Investigating how energy consumption varies throughout the day, on holidays, or identifying long-term trends.
3. **Seasonal Trends:** Understanding how daily energy consumption patterns change with the seasons, highlighting differences between summer and winter trends.

## Getting Started
To get started with this analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the analysis and models in action.
